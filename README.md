# my-feinstaub

This set of scripts will pull yesterdays data from http://archive.luftdaten.info
and store it locally. Afterwards it will show an matplotlib of yesterdays data and
hope hopefully someday send myself an E-Mail notification.

It is intentioned to be able to set annotations / tags to better understand the
individual data.
